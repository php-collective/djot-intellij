{#important-section}
## This heading has an ID

{.highlight .important}
This paragraph has multiple classes.

## Inline Attributes

This is [text with attributes]{.highlight #special-span}.

You can style [individual words]{style="color: red"} inline.

## Spans

Use square brackets for [inline spans]{.custom-class}.

Spans can have [multiple]{.one .two} [attributes]{#myid title="My Title"}.

## Divs

Divs use three or more colons:

It can contain multiple paragraphs and other block elements.

- Even lists
- Work inside divs
:::

Nested divs:

:::: outer
This is the outer div.

Back to outer div.
::::

Named divs with attributes:

## Footnotes

Here's a sentence with a footnote.[^1]

Another sentence with a different footnote.[^longnote]

[^1]: This is the first footnote.

[^longnote]: This is a longer footnote with multiple paragraphs.

    Indent subsequent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    You can even include code:

    ```
    code in footnote
    ```

## Math

Inline math: $`E = mc^2`

Display math:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

Another display equation:

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}
$$

## Superscript and Subscript

Water is H{~2~}O.

The 2{^nd^} element.

E = mc{^2^}

## Highlighting, Insertions, and Deletions

This is {=highlighted text=}.

This was {+inserted+} into the document.

This was {-deleted-} from the document.

Combined: The {-old{=highlighted=}-} text was {+replaced+}.

## Symbols

Use colons for symbols: :heart: :star: :warning:

## Smart Punctuation

- Em dash --- like this
- En dash -- for ranges
- Ellipsis ... for trailing off
- "Smart quotes" and 'single quotes'

## Line Blocks

Line blocks preserve line breaks:

| The quick brown fox
| jumps over
| the lazy dog.

| Roses are red,
|   Violets are blue,
| Sugar is sweet,
|   And so are you.
